## How to bring your own model to AWS SageMaker? 

AWS give a brief [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQyid2uLOvI&ab_channel=AmazonWebServices).



## There is a hands-on guide to docker in [this link](https://towardsdatascience.com/hands-on-guide-to-docker-for-data-science-d5d1f6f4a326)

Here are some notes:

1. Why use docker?

   Isolate applications, Collaborate better, Deployment to cloud services.

   > "like AWS becomes easier having everything encapsulated in a Dockerfile. You can just push it to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) and use this container in multiple places â€” say you want to deploy the model to AWS SageMaker, you can do so with just using the same Dockerfile and AWS deploys it for you."
